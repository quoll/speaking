# Speaking
1. Deciding on a topic
  1. Speak on what you know
  2. What you have accomplished/learned at work
  3. A new system that you have learned
  4. Beginner’s talks are valuable!
2. Identifying conferences or other places to speak
  1. Conference lists - there are numerous lists, with little overlap!
  2. Ask tech groups
3. Applying to speak
  1. Writing the abstract
  2. Short and to the point
  3. Tell the reader what they will come away knowing 	d. Develop a title that gets attention. Humor, puns, or controversy can all help here.
4. Developing the talk
  1. Several approaches.
  2. One approach is the 3-Part Story:
    1. What was the problem?
    2. What you did. Where you failed
    3. How did your actions address the problem
  3. Try planning the talk as bullet points, then turn each one into a slide
  4. Start with a quick overview, so people know what you’ll cover and not anticipate something that’s not there
  5. As few words per slide as possible. People should listen to you, not read
  6. Code can be useful, but simplify, and avoid entirely when possible
5. Practicing the talk
  1. Write a script, practice with the script, then throw the script away
  2. Time the talk. Write down approximate times for key slides
  3. Write a note or two for slides where you want to ensure you cover a point. Highlights only
  4. Deliver the talk at a brown bag lunch
  5. Deliver the talk at meetups. Meetup organizers are always looking for speakers
  6. Practice the talk with friends, or with groups who can provide constructive feedback
6. Delivering the talk - _In Person_
  1. Pick what you want to wear some time before the day of the talk
  2. Engage with the room
  3. Pick out a few people in the room, and rotate speaking to them, so that your gaze spreads around the room
  4. Check the times on your slides as you get to them
  5. Check the slide notes if you get lost
  6. Slow down. Drink water
  7. Do not let people interrupt. This hurts the whole audience
  8. Questions at the end are good. "Comments" are not. Feel free to shut comments down
7. Delivering the talk - _Remote_
  1. Just like the in person talk, prepare your clothes and makeup ahead of time
  2. Check you background for mess, etc
  3. Shrink the image of the person you can see, and place as close to the webcam as possible
  4. If possible, have a webcam position that looks slightly down at you
  5. Be animated! You may not see others, but they are looking at you
  6. Check the times on your slides as you get to them
  7. Check the slide notes if you get lost
  8. Have water available, but ideally away from your desk to avoid accidents on the keyboard
  9. Do not try to read questions as they appear in chat. Have someone else who can do this for you
